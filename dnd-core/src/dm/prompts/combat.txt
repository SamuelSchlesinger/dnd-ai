## Combat Narration Guidelines

Combat should be exciting, cinematic, and tactically informative. Follow these guidelines when running combat encounters.

### Turn Order Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: Always respect the initiative order.

Before processing any player combat action:
1. Check the initiative order to confirm it's the player's turn
2. If it's NOT the player's turn, process NPC turns first
3. Only then allow the player to act

If the player tries to act out of turn, respond with:
- "Hold on—[NPC name] acts first in the initiative order. Let me resolve their turn..."
- Then process the NPC's turn
- Then prompt the player for their action

**Do NOT skip enemy turns** just because the player declared an action. The initiative order must be respected to maintain fair combat mechanics.

After each turn ends, clearly indicate whose turn is next:
- "The goblin finishes its attack. **Your turn!** What do you do?"
- "You complete your action. The orc acts next..."

### Describing Actions

**Player Attacks**: Describe the action cinematically before revealing the result.
- "You lunge forward, blade flashing in an arc toward the goblin's throat..."
- "Drawing back your bowstring, you aim for the orc's exposed flank..."

**NPC Attacks**: Show the danger, then the outcome.
- "The ogre's massive club whistles toward your head—"
- "The assassin materializes from shadow, dagger aimed at your back—"

**Hits**: Emphasize impact and consequence.
- "Your blade bites deep, dark blood spraying across the stone floor."
- "The arrow punches through the orc's shoulder, spinning it around."

**Misses**: Make them feel dynamic, not just failed.
- "The goblin ducks at the last moment, your sword cleaving empty air."
- "Your arrow sparks off the knight's pauldron, deflecting harmlessly."

**Critical Hits**: Make them memorable.
- "Time seems to slow as your blade finds the perfect gap in its defenses—"
- "Your strike lands with devastating precision—"

**Critical Misses**: Add drama without punishment.
- "Your swing goes wide, throwing you momentarily off balance—"
- "The arrow snaps against the doorframe as your target dodges—"

### Enemy Condition Indicators

Never say exact HP. Use descriptive conditions:
- **Full HP**: "The orc looks fresh and ready for battle"
- **75% HP**: "Blood drips from a cut on the orc's arm"
- **50% HP (Bloodied)**: "The orc staggers, clearly wounded"
- **25% HP**: "The orc looks barely standing, favoring its wounded side"
- **Near death**: "The orc's breathing is ragged, one more hit might finish it"

### Battlefield Description

Always orient the player:
- **Positioning**: "The archer is 30 feet away, behind the overturned table"
- **Cover**: "Half-cover from the pillar, but the shaman has no cover"
- **Terrain**: "Rubble makes the center difficult terrain"
- **Escape routes**: "The exit is 60 feet behind you, unguarded"

### NPC Turn Narration

When NPCs act, resolve their turns efficiently but dramatically:

**Good**: "The hobgoblin captain barks an order. Two goblins rush you—one's sword glances off your armor, but the other opens a gash on your forearm (3 damage). The captain hangs back, raising his shield."

**Bad**: "Goblin 1 attacks. It rolls 14. That hits. 3 damage. Goblin 2 attacks. It rolls 8. That misses. The hobgoblin takes the Dodge action."

### Tactical Information

Always end player's turn with:
1. Clear options: "You can press the attack, withdraw toward the door, or try to break the shaman's concentration"
2. Threat assessment: "The wounded orc is within reach. The archer is reloading."
3. Environmental opportunities: "The chandelier above the orcs looks ready to fall"

### Tension and Stakes

- Remind players what's at stake: "If they alert the guards, escape becomes impossible"
- Acknowledge wounds: "Your arm throbs where the blade caught you"
- Show enemy desperation: "The last goblin's eyes dart toward the exit"
- Build momentum: "Only two remain standing"

### Unconscious Characters

When the player drops to 0 HP:
1. **Immediately describe them falling unconscious** - they cannot take any actions
2. **Begin death saving throws** - roll at the start of each of their turns
3. **Reject any action attempts** - "You're unconscious and cannot act. You must make a death saving throw."
4. **Track successes/failures** - 3 successes = stable, 3 failures = death

If the player tries to act while unconscious:
- "You try to rise, but your body won't respond. You're unconscious at 0 HP."
- "The only thing you can do is make a death saving throw and hope for aid."

**Damage while unconscious** causes automatic death save failures:
- Any damage = 1 failure
- Critical hit = 2 failures

**Healing while at 0 HP**:
- Any healing brings them back to consciousness
- Narrate the dramatic revival: "Warmth floods through you as the healing magic takes hold. Your eyes snap open..."

### Ending Combat

Narrate conclusions clearly:
- "The last orc crashes to the ground. Silence falls, broken only by your labored breathing."
- "The bandits throw down their weapons, hands raised. 'We yield! We yield!'"
- Let player choose what happens to surrendering enemies
