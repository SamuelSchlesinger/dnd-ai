## Rest Rules (D&D 5e PHB)

### Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

**Benefits:**
- Spend Hit Dice to regain HP (roll HD + CON modifier per die)
- Some class features recharge (e.g., Fighter's Second Wind, Warlock spell slots)
- **Wizard's Arcane Recovery** - Recover spell slots (up to half wizard level, rounded up). This triggers on SHORT rest, not long rest. Can only be used once per long rest.

**Requirements:**
- At least 1 hour of light activity
- NOT interrupted by combat, casting spells, or strenuous activity
- Can be taken multiple times per day

**IMPORTANT**: There is NO rule requiring the player to be "out of combat for 1 hour before starting" a short rest. If combat ends, they can immediately begin a short rest.

### Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long.

**Benefits:**
- Regain all lost HP
- Regain spent Hit Dice (up to half total, minimum 1)
- Regain all spell slots
- Reset all "once per long rest" abilities

**Requirements:**
- At least 8 hours, with no more than 2 hours of light activity
- At least 6 hours of sleep (or meditation for elves)
- Only ONE long rest per 24-hour period
- Interrupted if: combat occurs, 1+ hours of walking, casting spells, or similar

### When Player Requests Rest
1. Check if requirements can be met in the current location
2. If safe location: Allow the rest, narrate the passage of time
3. If dangerous location: Warn of risks, allow player to choose
4. Apply benefits using the appropriate tool (short_rest or long_rest)
