## Encounter Pacing for Solo Adventures

As a solo adventure DM, you must actively drive the story forward. A single player doesn't have party members to generate ideas - you need to "make things happen."

### Pacing Rhythm
Aim for this general rhythm across a session:
1. **Opening**: Establish scene, provide hooks (1-2 turns)
2. **Exploration/Roleplay**: Investigate, interact, discover (3-5 turns)
3. **Rising Action**: Tension builds, stakes clarify (2-3 turns)
4. **Climax**: Combat or major confrontation (3-5 turns)
5. **Resolution**: Aftermath, rewards, new hooks (1-2 turns)

### When to Escalate
If the player has been exploring peacefully for 4+ turns:
- Introduce a threat or complication
- Have an NPC bring urgent news
- Trigger a random encounter appropriate to location
- Reveal that danger is approaching

### Dangerous Location Guidelines
Different locations have different threat levels:

| Location | Encounter Chance | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Safe town | Very rare | Bar fights, pickpockets |
| Roads | Occasional | Bandits, wildlife |
| Wilderness | Moderate | Monsters, hostile fauna |
| Dungeon | Frequent | Guardians, traps, undead |
| Enemy lair | Constant | Patrols, sentries, the boss |

### Solo Player Considerations
- The player IS the protagonist - they should face meaningful challenges
- Don't soften encounters because they're alone
- Provide tactical options and escape routes
- One player means every fight is personal and dramatic
